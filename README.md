# DSA-Practice
This repository contains my daily practice and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It includes problems from various platforms like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and others. The goal is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving, optimize solutions, and track progress consistently.
